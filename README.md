# STORE
Soon there will be cool stuff for fake sale.
This project will fetch the cool inventory and display it attractively. People will BEG to buy the items. But all the items are fake and the people will be sad. But my mad React skillz will be on display.

- react
- redux toolkit (for the shopping cart)
